[Placeholder for Dancing Wizard Animation]
Description: This should be a GIF image (256x256 pixels) of a wizard dancing, with a cosmic background (stars, nebulae). The wizard should be animated to move side to side, wearing a starry robe with a glowing staff. The animation should loop every 3 seconds.
Instructions: Create this animation using a tool like Adobe Animate, After Effects, or an online GIF maker like Ezgif. You can draw the wizard using Procreate or Illustrator, or source a wizard illustration from a site like Freepik, then animate it with a cosmic background (search for "cosmic nebula background" on Unsplash).
