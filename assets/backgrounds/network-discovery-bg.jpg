[Placeholder for Network Discovery Background]
Description: This should be a JPG image (1920x1080 pixels) depicting a server room with dragons and animals (e.g., foxes, wolves) interacting with network equipment, set against a cosmic nebula backdrop. The scene should include glowing cables, servers with LED lights, and a starry sky visible through a window.
Instructions: Create this image using a 3D rendering tool like Blender or a graphic design tool like Photoshop. Alternatively, source a server room image from Unsplash, a dragon illustration from Freepik, and a cosmic nebula background, then composite them together. Add glowing effects using layer styles (e.g., outer glow in Photoshop).
